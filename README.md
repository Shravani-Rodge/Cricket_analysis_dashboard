Cricket Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
About This Project
Hey there! This is a Cricket Analysis Dashboard I created using Power BI, designed for cricket fans, analysts, and anyone curious about the game. The dashboard turns raw match data into clear, interactive visual insights—helping you explore how players and teams have performed across different seasons and formats.

Tools I Used
Power BI Desktop for creating visuals and reports.
Cricket Dataset

How to Use the Dashboard
1. Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Refresh the data (if needed) to make sure it’s up to date.
3. Use the slicers and filters to explore players, teams, and matches.
4. You can publish this to the Power BI Service if you want to share it online.

I built this project to combine my love of cricket with data visualization. It’s a simple yet powerful way to look at cricket stats without getting lost in spreadsheets. Hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
